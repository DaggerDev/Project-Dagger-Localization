# Project-Dagger-Localization
This is a guide for open source translations for Project Dagger.

ðŸ›‘ Before contributing make sure that any translations you provide are on your own Excel/Google Spreadsheet, whenever you are done you are to create a Github repository under the CC0 license and publish your translations there or include the CC0 license in the folder with your spreadsheet when creating a pull request here. Also you understand that any contributions to helping translate Project Dagger do not come with financial compensation, and that you accept your translations being used within the game whenever you provide a Github repo link or contribute a list of translations. That contribution to this repository and to Project Dagger you hereby assign copyright to this Project, and to be licensed under the same agreement (CC0) as the Project.

ðŸ’¬ Project Dagger uses a fairly simple system, there is a list of strings that are formatted a specific way. For example, "Game.Item.Mead.Defense.4" Is how the game will look for localizations for the item Mead of Defense++++. Another example would be "Game.Paused" which is how the game looks for Game Paused which is displayed when you press Escape while playing the game and the pause menu appears.

ðŸ’¬ I am working on a system where users can patch in languages that are not officially supported within the game. I will try based on community feedback though whenever a new lanaguage becomes supported to add that list into the game as soon as possible.

ðŸ’¬ Anyone that does contribute though to localizing new languages and gets their list or even their contribution added into the game I will add to the credits menu, although it will likely be Github username/name.

ðŸ’» Now how does the game load and use this information? It's rather simple, they must be exported as a CSV or Comma Separated Value file in the same format as this one here http://hya.to/TRZipmgaL5 This is the english translations list and the CSV should not have any other columns or information other than the language that the translations belong to, that way the game won't have any issues loading in the language.

ðŸ’¬ If you have any questions regarding all of this, consider joining the Discord! : https://discord.gg/DjpCanQFwx

ðŸŒŽ Also it would mean a lot if you do contribute to translating what goes on in Project Dagger to also consider translating the Store Page as well! My goal is for Project Dagger to evolve in a way where it's constantly becoming more and more fun and to reach as many people as possible.
